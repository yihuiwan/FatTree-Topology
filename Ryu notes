        # OFPActionOutput class is used with a packet_out message to specify a switch port that you want to send the packet out of. 
          This application uses the OFPP_FLOOD flag to indicate that the packet should be sent out on all ports.
        # OFPPacketOut class is used to build a packet_out message.
        # If you call Datapath class's send_msg method with a OpenFlow message class object, Ryu builds and sends the on-wire data format to the switch.
